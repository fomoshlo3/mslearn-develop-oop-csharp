## Exercise scenario

Suppose you're a software developer at a tech company working on a banking application. Your team needs to implement collection types to manage customers, accounts, and transactions efficiently. To ensure consistent behavior, you decide to create and implement these operations in a simple console application.

You've developed an initial version of the app that includes the following files:

- `Program.cs`: This file contains the main entry point of the application, demonstrating the creation and manipulation of collection types.
- `Bank.cs`: This file defines the `Bank` class, which includes methods for managing customers and transaction reports.
- `BankCustomer.cs`: This file defines the `BankCustomer` class, which includes properties and methods for managing customer accounts.
- `BankAccount.cs`: This file defines the `BankAccount` class, which includes properties and methods for managing transactions.
- `Transaction.cs`: This file defines the `Transaction` class, which includes properties for transaction details such as account ID, amount, description, and date.
- `SimulateDepositWithdrawTransfer.cs`: This file contains methods for simulating deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

1. Review the code.
1. Implement the `Bank` class.
1. Update the `BankCustomer` class.
1. Update the `BankAccount` class.
1. Create the `Transaction` class.
1. Create the `SimulateDepositWithdrawTransfer` class.
1. Use a `HashSet` to ensure unique transactions.
1. Generate transaction reports using a `Dictionary`.

## Task 1: Create and manage objects in `Program.cs`

You will implement functionality to create `Bank`, `BankCustomer`, and `BankAccount` objects, add accounts to customers and customers to the bank, simulate transactions, ensure unique transactions using a `HashSet`, and generate a report of transactions within a date range. Each step aligns with a `// Task 1` comment in the `Program.cs` file to help you locate where to add the code.

### Task 1 Steps

1. **Create a `Bank` object**  
   Open the `Program.cs` file and locate the `// Task 1` comment. Add the following code below it:

   ```csharp
   // Task 1: Create a Bank object
   Bank myBank = new Bank("MyBank");
   ```

   > **Note:** This creates a bank named "MyBank" that will hold customers and their accounts.

1. **Create `BankCustomer` and `BankAccount` objects**  
   Add the following code below the previous step:

   ```csharp
   // Task 1: Create BankCustomer and BankAccount objects
   BankCustomer customer1 = new BankCustomer("Alice", "Smith");
   BankAccount account1 = new CheckingAccount(customer1.CustomerId, 1000);
   ```

   > **Note:** This creates a customer named Alice Smith and a checking account with a $1,000 balance.

1. **Add accounts to customers and customers to the bank**  
   Add the following code below the previous step:

   ```csharp
   // Task 1: Add accounts to customers and customers to the bank
   customer1.AddAccount(account1);
   myBank.AddCustomer(customer1);
   ```

   > **Note:** This links the account to the customer and the customer to the bank.

1. **Simulate deposits, withdrawals, and transfers**  
   Add the following code below the previous step:

   ```csharp
   // Task 1: Simulate deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
   SimulateDepositWithdrawTransfer simulator = new SimulateDepositWithdrawTransfer();
   simulator.SimulateDeposit(account1, 500);
   simulator.SimulateWithdrawal(account1, 300);
   ```

   > **Note:** This adds $500 to the account and then removes $300.

1. **Use a `HashSet` to ensure unique transactions**  
   Add the following code below the previous step:

   ```csharp
   // Task 1: Use a HashSet to ensure unique transactions
   HashSet<Transaction> uniqueTransactions = new HashSet<Transaction>(account1.Transactions);
   ```

   > **Note:** This ensures that duplicate transactions are not added to the list.

1. **Generate a report of transactions within a date range**  
   Add the following code below the previous step:

   ```csharp
   // Task 1: Generate a report of transactions within a date range
   Console.WriteLine("\nTransaction Report:");
   foreach (var transaction in uniqueTransactions)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"Transaction ID: {transaction.TransactionId}, Type: {transaction.Type}, Amount: {transaction.Amount:C}, Date: {transaction.Date}");
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** This displays all unique transactions for the account.
