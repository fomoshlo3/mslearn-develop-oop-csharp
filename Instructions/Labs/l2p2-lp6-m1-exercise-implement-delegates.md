# Implement delegates in a C# app

Delegates enable developers to encapsulate methods and pass them as parameters, allowing for flexible and extensible code design. Delegates are useful when implementing callback methods, custom sorting or filtering, and many other programming scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> Delegates are also used as event handlers, where you define a delegate type that represents the signature of the event handler methods. The implementation of event publishers and subscribers is covered separately.

In this exercise, you declare, instantiate, and invoke delegates that implement callback and custom sorting scenarios. You implement custom delegates to perform callback and sorting scenarios, and then replace the custom delegates with strongly typed `Action` and `Func` delegates that reduce code complexity and improve readability.

This exercise takes approximately **20** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

Before you can start this exercise, you need to:

1. Ensure that you have the latest short term support (STS) version of the .NET SDK installed on your computer. You can download the latest versions of the .NET SDK using the following URL: <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/" target="_blank">Download .NET</a>

1. Ensure that you have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. You can download Visual Studio Code using the following URL: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download/" target="_blank">Download Visual Studio Code</a>

1. Ensure that you have the C# Dev Kit configured in Visual Studio Code.

For additional help configuring the Visual Studio Code environment, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/install-configure-visual-studio-code/" target="_blank">Install and configure Visual Studio Code for C# development</a>

## Exercise scenario

Suppose you've agreed to help a non-profit company with a software project. Before the project kicks off, you decide to update your object-oriented programming skills by developing a banking app. The current version of your app supports basic operations such as creating accounts, making deposits and withdrawals, and transferring funds between accounts. To practice implementing delegates, you're going add delegates to the `Bank` and `BankAccount` classes. You plan to start by implementing custom delegates and then transition to strongly typed delegates that implement the same behavior.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

1. Review the current version of your banking app.

1. Implement a custom delegate that performs callback tasks after adding transactions to an account.

1. Implement a custom delegate that returns a list of sorted customers.

1. Replace custom delegates with strongly typed `Action` and `Func` delegates.

## Review the current version of your banking app

In this task, you download the existing version of your banking app and review the code.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Download the starter code from the following URL: [Implement delegates in a C# app - exercise code projects](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-develop-oop-csharp/raw/refs/heads/main/DownloadableCodeProjects/Downloads/LP6SampleApps.zip)

1. Extract the contents of the LP6SampleApps.zip file to a folder location on your computer.

    For example, if your running Windows, you can extract the file contents to your Desktop folder.

1. Expand the LP6SampleApps folder, and then open the `Delegates` folder.

    The Delegates folder contains the following code project folders:

    - Solution
    - Starter

    The **Starter** folder contains the starter project files for this exercise.

1. Use Visual Studio Code to open the **Starter** folder.

1. In the EXPLORER view, collapse the **STARTER** folder, select **SOLUTION EXPLORER**, and expand the **Delegates** project folders.

    You should see the following project folders and files:

    - Config
        - ApprovedCustomers.json
    - Interfaces
        - IBankAccount.cs
        - IBankCustomer.cs
        - IMonthlyReportable.cs
        - IQuarterlyReportable.cs
        - IYearlyReportable.cs
    - Models
        - Bank.cs
        - BankAccount.cs
        - BankCustomer.cs
        - BankCustomerMethods.cs
        - CheckingAccount.cs
        - MoneyMarketAccount.cs
        - SavingsAccount.cs
        - Transaction.cs
    - Services
        - AccountCalculations.cs
        - AccountReportGenerator.cs
        - ApprovedCustomerLoaderAsync.cs
        - BankAccountDTO.cs
        - BankCustomerDTO.cs
        - CreateDataLogsAsync.cs
        - CustomerReportGenerator.cs
        - Extensions.cs
        - JsonRetrievalAsync.cs
        - JsonStorageAsync.cs
        - LoadCustomerLogsAsync.cs
        - SimulateDepositsWithdrawalsTransfers.cs
    - Program.cs

1. Take a few minutes to open and review each of the following files:

    - `Bank.cs`: This file defines the Bank class, which implements a collection of bank customers and provides methods that manage customers and retrieve bank information.

    - `BankAccount.cs`: This file defines the BankAccount class, which implements the IBankAccount interface and includes properties, constructors, and methods for account operations.

    - `BankCustomer.cs`: This file defines the BankCustomer partial class, which implements the IBankCustomer interface and includes properties and constructors for customer constructor.

    - `CreateDataLogsAsync.cs`: This file includes a method that uses `ApprovedCustomerLoaderAsync` and `SimulateDepositsWithdrawalsTransfers` to generate two years of transactions for 50 bank customers, and then stores the data as JSON files using `JsonStorageAsync`.

    - `SimulateDepositsWithdrawalsTransfers.cs`: This file uses methods of the account classes to simulate deposits, withdrawals, and transfers for a bank account.

    - `Program.cs`: This file provides the main entry point for the app. Program.cs uses `CreateDataLogsAsync` to save two years of bank transactions to JSON files for 50 customers, and then uses `LoadCustomerLogsAsync` to load the customer data into a `bank` object.

    Notice that a bank object includes a collection of bank customer objects, and that each bank customer object includes a collection of bank account objects for that customer. Each account object includes a collection of transactions, which provide a record of the deposits, withdrawals, and transfers associated with the account. The `SimulateDepositsWithdrawalsTransfers` class is used simulate customer account activity by generating transactions for each account. The app is able to store and retrieve customer and account information.

1. Run the app and review the output in the terminal window.

    To run your app, right-click the **Delegates** project in the Solution Explorer, select **Debug**, and then select **Start New Instance**.

    Your app should produce output that's similar to the following example:

    ```plaintext

    Bank information...
    Number of customers: 50
    Number of accounts: 150
    Number of transactions: 24443
    
    ```

    The output shows the names of the 50 customer objects that were created. Each customer has three account types: Checking, Savings, and MoneyMarket. The simulator generates about 20 transactions per month for each customer, so each customer has about 480 transactions spread across two years. The transactions are mostly associated with the checking accounts. Transactions include deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and bank refunds.

## Implement a custom delegate that performs callback tasks after adding transactions to an account

Delegates can be used to implement callback methods that run when an asynchronous operation completes. In this task, you implement a custom delegate that performs callback tasks after adding transactions to an account. In this scenario, a callback delegate can be used to log transactions or perform additional actions based on the type of transaction.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Open the BankAccount.cs file and then scroll to the top of the file.

1. To add the delegate definition above the BankAccount class, update the code as follows:

    ```csharp
    
    namespace Delegates;
    
    public delegate void TransactionProcessedCallback(Transaction transaction);
    
    // Method to add a transaction to the account
    public class BankAccount : IBankAccount
    
    ```

1. Scroll down to the end of the file and locate the `AddTransaction` method.

1. To include the `TransactionProcessedCallback` delegate as a parameter of the `AddTransaction` method, update the `AddTransaction` method as follows:

    ```csharp
    
    public void AddTransaction(Transaction transaction, TransactionProcessedCallback? callback = null)
    {
        _transactions.Add(transaction);
        callback?.Invoke(transaction); // Invoke the callback if provided
    }
    
    ```

    This updated `AddTransaction` method now accepts a delegate of type `TransactionProcessedCallback` as an optional parameter. The method adds the transaction to the `_transactions` list and then invokes the callback if it's provided. The `?` operator is used to safely invoke the callback if it isn't null.

1. Scroll up to find the `Deposit` method.

    You'll modify the deposit method to implement a callback when the deposit corresponds to a bank refund.

1. To invoke the delegate when a bank refund transaction is detected, update the `Deposit` method as follows:

    ```csharp
    
    public virtual void Deposit(double amount, DateOnly transactionDate, TimeOnly transactionTime, string description)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            priorBalance = Balance;
            Balance += amount;
            string transactionType = "Deposit";
            if (description.Contains("-(TRANSFER)"))
            {
                transactionType = "Transfer";
                AddTransaction(new Transaction(transactionDate, transactionTime, priorBalance, amount, AccountNumber, AccountNumber, transactionType, description));
            }
            else if (description.Contains("-(BANK REFUND)"))
            {
                transactionType = "Bank Refund";
                AddTransaction(new Transaction(transactionDate, transactionTime, priorBalance, amount, AccountNumber, AccountNumber, transactionType, description), transaction =>
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Log the refund to customer {Owner.ReturnFullName()} for account {AccountNumber}.");
                });
            }
            else
            {
                transactionType = "Deposit";
                AddTransaction(new Transaction(transactionDate, transactionTime, priorBalance, amount, AccountNumber, AccountNumber, transactionType, description));
            }
        }
    }
    
    ```

    When the `Deposit` method detects a bank refund transaction, it invokes the `AddTransaction` method with a lambda expression that logs the refund to the console. The lambda expression is passed as the callback delegate. The logging message includes the customer's full name and the account number. In a production app, you would want to log this information to a file or a database instead of the console.

1. Open the IBankAccount.cs file and then scroll to the top of the file.

    You need to update the interface to include the delegate as a parameter of the `AddTransaction` method.

1. To include the delegate as a parameter of the `AddTransaction` method, update the method signature as follows:

    ```csharp
    
    void AddTransaction(Transaction transaction, TransactionProcessedCallback? transactionProcessedCallback = null);
    
    ```

1. Run the app and notice the logging messages generated by the delegate.

    Each time the app detects a bank refund transaction, a message is written to the console. This should occur 24 time for each customer, once for each month of the two-year period. The logging messages are generated by the lambda expression passed to the `AddTransaction` method.

    Logging messages should appear similar to the following output:

    ```plaintext

    Log the refund to customer Yasemin Ozkan for account 13442121.
    
    ```

## Implement a custom delegate that returns a list of sorted customers

Delegates can be used to implement customized sorting based on runtime criteria, such as name, total balance, or number of accounts.

In this task you sort customers by their total balance and then by name using the same custom delegate.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Open the Bank.cs file and then scroll to the top of the file.

1. Add the delegate definition above the Bank class:

    ```csharp

    public delegate int CustomerComparison(BankCustomer x, BankCustomer y);

    ```

1. To create a method that accepts a delegate for sorting, add the following code to the Bank class:

    ```csharp

    public IEnumerable<BankCustomer> GetSortedCustomers(CustomerComparison comparison)
    {
        var sortedCustomers = _customers.ToList();
        sortedCustomers.Sort((x, y) => comparison(x, y));
        return sortedCustomers;
    }

    ```

    The `GetSortedCustomers` method is a public method that provides a way to retrieve a sorted list of bank customers based on a custom sorting logic. This method is highly flexible because it uses the `CustomerComparison` delegate to define the sorting criteria.

    Inside the method, the `_customers` list (a private field containing all customers of the bank) is first converted to a new `List<BankCustomer>` using `ToList()`. This ensures that the original list is not modified. The `Sort` method is then called on this new list, using a lambda function. The lambda function takes two `BankCustomer` objects (`x` and `y`) and applies the comparison delegate to determine their relative order. The `Sort` method uses the comparison delegate to sort the list in place. The lambda function is a concise way to pass the comparison logic without needing to create a separate method for it.

    The method returns the sorted list as an `IEnumerable<BankCustomer>`. By returning an IEnumerable, the method provides a read-only view of the sorted customers, ensuring that the caller can't modify the internal state of the bank's customer list.

1. Open the Program.cs file and then scroll to the bottom of the file.

1. To sort customers by total balance, enter the following code to the end of the `Main` method:

    ```csharp

    var sortedCustomers = bank.GetSortedCustomers((x, y) =>
    {
        double balanceX = x.Accounts.Sum(a => a.Balance);
        double balanceY = y.Accounts.Sum(a => a.Balance);
        return balanceY.CompareTo(balanceX); // Descending order
    });
    
    Console.WriteLine("\nCustomers sorted by total balance:");
    foreach (var customer in sortedCustomers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{customer.ReturnFullName()} - Total Balance: {customer.Accounts.Sum(a => a.Balance):C}");
    }

    ```

    This code implements a delegate to sort the customers by their total balance in descending order. The `GetSortedCustomers` method is called with a lambda expression that compares the total balances of two customers. The `Sum` method is used to calculate the total balance of each customer by summing the balances of all their accounts.

1. Run the app and review the output.

    The list of sorted customers should be displayed at the bottom of the console.

    Notice that the customers are sorted by total balance in descending order. The output should be similar to the following:

    ```plaintext

    Customers sorted by total balance:
    Alain Davignon - Total Balance: $109,928.85
    Claude Aupry - Total Balance: $109,917.25

    Jun Uchida - Total Balance: $108,337.95
    Hannah Weber - Total Balance: $108,280.95
    Janez Horvat - Total Balance: $108,233.90
    Nedelya Grigorova - Total Balance: $108,109.75
    Renata Amaya - Total Balance: $108,090.30
    Erna Nilsson - Total Balance: $108,020.80
    Ivan Krajnc - Total Balance: $107,776.80
    Rayko Dimitrov - Total Balance: $107,596.80

    Petros Doudis - Total Balance: $107,504.35
    Cao Huy - Total Balance: $107,086.30
    Viktor Magnusson - Total Balance: $107,084.25
    Akkarat Leelapun - Total Balance: $107,033.95
    Julia Linares - Total Balance: $106,915.15
    Sergio Valladares - Total Balance: $106,877.90
    Bong-Jin Lee - Total Balance: $106,361.80
    Genevieve Arcouet - Total Balance: $105,963.80
    Peter Zammit - Total Balance: $105,602.05
    Tatiana Seleznyova - Total Balance: $105,384.35
    Staffan Bergqvist - Total Balance: $105,377.60
    Milena Stoichkova - Total Balance: $105,329.45
    Kasper Frisk - Total Balance: $104,989.60
    Conrad Nuber - Total Balance: $104,921.25
    Hannah Haynes - Total Balance: $104,772.90
    Larissa Sevilla - Total Balance: $104,663.00
    Yasemin Ozkan - Total Balance: $104,586.05
    Niki Demetriou - Total Balance: $104,568.30
    Rayna Bacheva - Total Balance: $104,547.65
    Anna Hedlund - Total Balance: $104,468.70
    Elize Harmsen - Total Balance: $104,389.50
    Phung Hang - Total Balance: $104,361.50
    Chingfan Chou - Total Balance: $104,317.05
    Suttida Bunyasarn - Total Balance: $104,303.30
    Danielle Brasseur - Total Balance: $104,210.35
    Faruk Keskin - Total Balance: $104,204.05
    Mattia Trentini - Total Balance: $103,792.85
    Elaheh Mansouri - Total Balance: $103,348.25
    Maya Meyerson - Total Balance: $102,771.45
    Afshin Behzadi - Total Balance: $101,767.81
    Ethan Brooks - Total Balance: $101,747.83

    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Transactions are generated using random values. The final account balances, and the order of customers will vary each time you run the app.

1. To demonstrate using the delegate to sort by name rather than by balance, add the following code to the end of the `Main` method:

    ```csharp

    // Implement customer sorting using a delegate - sort by name
    var sortedCustomersByName = bank.GetSortedCustomers((x, y) =>
    {
        int lastNameComparison = x.LastName.CompareTo(y.LastName);
        return lastNameComparison != 0 ? lastNameComparison : x.FirstName.CompareTo(y.FirstName);
    });

    Console.WriteLine("\nCustomers sorted by name:");
    foreach (var customer in sortedCustomersByName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{customer.ReturnFullName()} - Total Balance: {customer.Accounts.Sum(a => a.Balance):C}");
    }

    ```

    The `GetSortedCustomers` method is called with a lambda expression that compares the last names of two customers. If the last names are equal, it compares their first names.

1. Run the app again and review the output.

    You shee that the second list of customers is sorted by name in ascending order. The output should be similar to the following:

    ```plaintext

    Customers sorted by name:
    Renata Amaya - Total Balance: $104,161.75

## Replace custom delegates with strongly typed `Action` and `Func` delegates

In C#, strongly typed delegates like `Action` and `Func` provide a way to define and use delegates without explicitly declaring custom delegate types. These strongly typed delegates are part of the `System` namespace and are commonly used for scenarios involving callbacks, event handling, and other scenaraios where passing methods as parameters is required.

In this task, you replace custom delegate types with strongly typed delegates in the BankAccount and Bank classes.

1. Open the BankAccount.cs file, and then scroll to the top of the file.

1. Comment out the custom delegate definition:

    ```csharp

    // public delegate void TransactionProcessedCallback(Transaction transaction);

    ```

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the file and locate the `AddTransaction` method.

1. To replace the custom delegate with `Action<Transaction>`, update the method using the following code:

    ```csharp

    // public void AddTransaction(Transaction transaction, TransactionProcessedCallback? callback = null)
    // {
    //     _transactions.Add(transaction);
    //     callback?.Invoke(transaction); // Invoke the callback if provided
    // }

    public void AddTransaction(Transaction transaction, Action<Transaction>? callback = null)
    {
        _transactions.Add(transaction);
        callback?.Invoke(transaction); // Invoke the callback if provided
    }

    ```

1. Open the IBankAccount.cs file and then scroll to the top of the file.

1. To replace the custom delegate with `Action<Transaction>`, update the IBankAccount interface:

    ```csharp

    // void AddTransaction(Transaction transaction, TransactionProcessedCallback? transactionProcessedCallback = null);
    void AddTransaction(Transaction transaction, Action<Transaction>? transactionProcessedCallback = null);

    ```

1. Open the Bank.cs file.

    You will be replacing the `CustomerComparison` delegate with `Func<BankCustomer, BankCustomer, int>`, which is a strongly typed delegate that takes two `BankCustomer` objects and returns an integer.

1. Scroll to the top of the file and then comment out the custom delegate definition:

    ```csharp

    // public delegate int CustomerComparison(BankCustomer x, BankCustomer y);

    ```

1. Scroll down to find the `GetSortedCustomers` method in the Bank class.

1. To replace the custom delegate with `Func<BankCustomer, BankCustomer, int>`, update the method using the following code:

    ```csharp

    // public IEnumerable<BankCustomer> GetSortedCustomers(CustomerComparison comparison)
    // {
    //     var sortedCustomers = _customers.ToList();
    //     sortedCustomers.Sort((x, y) => comparison(x, y));
    //     return sortedCustomers;
    // }

    public IEnumerable<BankCustomer> GetSortedCustomers(Func<BankCustomer, BankCustomer, int> comparison)
    {
        var sortedCustomers = _customers.ToList();
        sortedCustomers.Sort((x, y) => comparison(x, y));
        return sortedCustomers;
    }

    ```

1. Run the app and review the output.

    Notice that the strongly typed delegates (`Action` and `Func`) enable the same flexible behavior as the custom delegates, but with less code complexity and improved readability.

In this exercise, you learned how to declare, instantiate, and invoke delegates for scenarios that require dynamic method invocation. You implemented callback and sorting scenarios using custom delegates, and then replaced the custom delegates with strongly typed `Action` and `Func` delegates that reduce code complexity while providing the same functionality. You also learned how to use lambda expressions to define the delegate logic inline, which can make your code more concise and easier to read.

## Clean up

Now that you've finished the exercise, consider archiving your project files for review at a later time. Having your own projects available for review can be a valuable resource when you're learning to code. Also, building up a portfolio of projects can be a great way to demonstrate your skills to potential employers.
